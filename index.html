        <p> Welcome to my website! I am a problem solver and innovator in the intersection of audio technology and music
            informatics. My
            focus lies in machine learning and deep learning applications in music and audio signals. </p>

        <p> I earned my Ph.D. in Music Informatics from the SAIGE lab at Indiana University under <a
                href="https://minjekim.com/">Prof. Minje Kim</a>, focusing on <a
                    href="https://saige.sice.indiana.edu/wp-content/uploads/phd_dissertation_swager.pdf">data-driven
                pitch correction for singing voice</a>,
            along with a Master's
            in Computer Science. This was preceded by a Bachelor's in Bassoon Performance from Indiana University's
            <a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/"> Jacobs School of Music</a>, where I studied with Prof. Kathleen
            McLean. </p>

        <p>Professionally, I've navigated a wide array of challenges in audio technology, from differentiable
            digital signal processing to speech denoising and music signal matching. My career has spanned Google
            Android Audio, Smule, Spotify, and now Amazon Devices, where I merge my passion for sound with technological
            innovation. At Amazon, I've implemented deep-learning models on the edge. </p>

        <p>I'm dedicated to innovating in the audio technology space, aiming to create experiences that connect
            users to good audio quality and music. I'm always open to connect, collaborate, and discuss new ideas.</p>

<!--            I am interested in how technology influences the way people relate to music, and how we can use technology-->
<!--            to develop our understanding of music. Music has been at the front end of technical innovation for thousands-->
<!--            of years. Pythagoras described its deep connection to math, architecture, astronomy, and psychology;-->
<!--            Beethoven worked with piano makers to develop instruments that could handle his compositions; conductor-->
<!--            Herbert von Karajan was among the first to acquire the newest analog recording devices. I strive to promote-->
<!--            interaction between the fields of acoustic music and computing so that the recent innovation in the digital-->
<!--            world can be applied in the best possible way to music. I hope to 1) develop knowledge of music-->
<!--            representation in technology, so that results are aesthetically convincing, 2) give musicians more general-->
<!--            and easy access to training in music technology, and 3) encourage the development of music-related-->
<!--            technology that helps the youngest generation connect to high-quality music as listeners and performers.-->
