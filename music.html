        <p>
            This piece explores the similarity between the violin and the human voice through the sounds of laughter and
            vibrato. All sounds are built from violin recordings, performed by <a
                href=http://www.citymusiccleveland.org/AboutUs/musicians_details.php?mid=291> Minju Kim</a>. Imitations
            of laughter on the violin are followed by laughter sounds reconstructed<SUP>(1)</SUP> from violin sounds. A
            climbing melody follows, with multiple layers of transposition, then introduces a falling Shepard tone<SUP>(2)</SUP>
            that uses long violin tones instead of pure sine waves for a rich sound world. MaxMSP was used for the
            transpositions, and Digital Performer for combining the sound tracks.</p>
        <p>
            (1) The recording of laughter is turned into a series of frames using Fourier analysis. For every frame, a
            search through a database of violin recording frames determines the closest match in terms of amplitude and
            phase in all bins. This match replaces the original laughter frame. </p>
        <p>
            (2) A Shepard tone is an auditory illusion of a never-ending glissando. Multiple layers of partials slide
            down a large interval (sometimes up to ten octaves), starting with zero amplitude, growing to a maximum
            close to the mid range, and decaying back to zero.

        <p> Built solely from close-up recordings of bassoon keys, <em> Bassoon Key Thunderstorm </em> explores the
            sounds of a rainstorm passing by while thunder booms in the distance. Tools such as granulation,
            transposition, reverberation and equalization are used to modify the original sounds.</p>

        <p><em>Office Digression</em> explores the interaction between sounds of different environments and how they
            compete for our attention. An imaginary subject's attention is brought to the sounds of an office after
            closing windows shut out the song of frogs in the Amazonian forest. The subject's daydreaming transforms the
            typing clicks into clicks of a bicycle chain, transporting them on a gravelly bicycle ride in the outside
            forest, whose sounds are distorted in the subject's dreams. At this point, hints of the office sounds, such
            as faxes, printers and walking on heels, can be heard trying to intrude into the dream and wake the subject
            up. The progressively strengthening intrusion finally causes an awakening, a sudden disappearance of the
            dream and return of the office environment. The ticking sound is built from the sound of heels transposed in
            pitch and time, respectively two and three times faster and higher. The fax sounds in the dream are created
            through subtractive synthesis of pitches less than a quarter tone apart. </p>
        <p> Recordings of the Amazonian forest, bike chain and heels were downloaded from <a
